Fourth session of the Code Clinic.

No real problems to fix on this one, so I cleaned up a bit some old demo code for Calcium Imaging image (video) analysis. The code is meant to be just a toy example of image analysis in MATLAB (and in no ways meant to be the best approach for this particular problem). See the code in the [repository](https://github.com/Leo-GG/CodeClinicCABHC/blob/master/Examples/2019-05-23/)
