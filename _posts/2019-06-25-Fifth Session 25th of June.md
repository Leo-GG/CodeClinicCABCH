Fifth session of the Code Clinic.

We did some more work on Calcium imaging today. 
Laura wanted a method to get the intensity changes over time on a region of interest. 
So, we built on the code I had prepared last week and made a simple example on how to get the intensity changes on a square region.
See the code on the [repository](https://github.com/Leo-GG/CodeClinicCABHC/tree/master/Examples/2019-06-25).
