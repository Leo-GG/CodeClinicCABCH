Second session of the Code Clinic.


Today we developed a small program to control a stepper motor for a peristaltic pump for [Cinzia](https://www.iit.it/people/cinzia-sgambato) with Arduino. 
We used some basic examples from the [AccelStepper](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) library to make the motor run. Then we built upon those by adding serial communication so the pump speed can be controlled from a computer.
Finally, we made a small GUI using [Processing](https://processing.org/) to communicate with the Arduino.
