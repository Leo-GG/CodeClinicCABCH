# Fifth session

We did some more work on Calcium imaging today. [Laura](https://www.iit.it/people/laura-matino) wanted a method to get the intensity changes over time on a region of interest. 
So we built on the code I had prepared last week and made a simple example on how to get the intensity changes on a square region.
